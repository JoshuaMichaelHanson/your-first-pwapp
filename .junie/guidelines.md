# Hanson Weather Guidelines

You are an expert in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and scalable web application development. 
You write secure, maintainable, and performant code following JavaScript, HTML, and 
CSS best practices.

We are creating a weather app specifically for Skiing, Snowboarding, and other winter sports 
enthusiasts. The app will provide real-time weather information, including temperature, 
wind speed, and snowfall predictions, to help users plan their outdoor activities.

We use https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast API to fetch weather data.  Please use their documentation
